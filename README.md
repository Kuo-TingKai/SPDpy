# SPD
Multi agent simulation code of Prisoner's Dilemma Game on a complex network topology.<br>

When running the simulation,just type <br>

$ python SPD.py <br>
After that, many output files will be generated. You can visualize the result with heatmap.py.<br>

$ python heatmap.py <br>
<br>

Depending on the topology and strategy update rule, you can see various Dg-Dr diagram.


<br>
Network topology can be selected from these three types.
* Lattice(2D Grid, default setting)
* Random Regular Network
* Barabashi-Albert Scale Free Network
